## Introduction and Install

GroupThink is a package designed to assist in the analysis in categorical survey data. It mainly acts as an interface for existing `tidyverse` functions - but makes it easier to aggregate responses, do cross-question analysis, and avoid classic mistakes typical of survey data analysis.

It currently has two functions:`unify()` and `assess()` (though others are planned for the future...!).

GroupThink isn't on CRAN, so you'll need to use `devtools` to install it. Run:

```{r install, results='hide', warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("Samuel-Osian-Andrews/GroupThink")
library(GroupThink)
```

As GroupThink is still in development, you should periodically reinstall the package to get updates.

### Dependencies

GroupThink depends on `dplyr`, `tidyr` and `gt` libraries. If these aren't installed automatically when you install GroupThink, you may need to run:

```{r dependencies, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', error=FALSE}
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "gt"))
```

## Benefits of GroupThink

GroupThink is a response to key bottlenecks and common mistakes when analysing survey data. The function is beneficial because it...

-   **Allows for easy groupings.** `unify()` makes it very easy to group together different Likert-style responses (e.g. combining `Somewhat agree` with `Strongly agree`, or `Excellent` and `Very good`). It's now extremely difficult to make mistakes with incorrect groupings, as `unify()` alerts you of any unassigned responses.

-   **Automates your calculations.** `unify()` handles n and proportion calculations for you, meaning you no longer have to undertake complex data manipulation tasks, avoiding functions such as `pivot_longer()`, which can result in inaccurate figures if you're not careful!

-   **Works with full questions as column headers.** Typically, exporting survey responses (such as from Microsoft Forms or SurveyMonkey) will leave you with full questions (e.g. "Do you agree or disagree that...") as column headers. This is usually a nightmare to work with in R. Because `unify()` works on column indexes, rather than column names, you don't need to worry about recoding your columns or typing out full survey questions throughout your code.

-   **Gives usable outputs.**. `unify()` neatly integrates with ggplot, allowing you to visualise your aggregated data. Alternatively, you can produce formatted tables through the gtTable argument.

-   **Presents clear, readable syntax.** Even for those unfamiliar with R syntax, `unify()` makes it very clear exactly how you've grouped together your responses, improving readability and reproducibility.

-   **Means faster insights.** With just a few lines of code, this function could save you hours worth of work for large survey projects.

```{r simulate, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Activate libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

# Create a sample dataset
set.seed(1357)

data <- tibble(
  
  `I find the course material engaging and relevant.` = factor(sample(
    c("Strongly agree", "Somewhat agree", "Neither agree nor disagree", "Somewhat disagree", "Strongly disagree", "Don't know"),
    100, replace = TRUE), levels = c("Strongly disagree", "Somewhat disagree", "Neither agree nor disagree", "Somewhat agree", "Strongly agree", "Don't know")),
  
  `The course workload is manageable within my schedule.` = factor(sample(
    c("Highly agree", "Agree", "Neither agree nor disagree", "Disagree", "Highly disagree", "Unsure"),
    100, replace = TRUE), levels = c("Highly disagree", "Disagree", "Neither agree nor disagree", "Agree", "Highly agree", "Unsure")),
  `Feedback from assignments is helpful for my learning.` = factor(sample(
    c("Strongly agree", "Agree", "Indifferent", "Disagree", "Strongly disagree", "No opinion"),
    100, replace = TRUE), levels = c("Strongly disagree", "Disagree", "Indifferent", "Agree", "Strongly agree", "No opinion"))
)

# Function to randomly introduce NAs into a vector
introduce_NAs <- function(x, Proportion = 0.05) {
  na_indices <- sample(1:length(x), size = floor(Proportion * length(x)), replace = FALSE)
  x[na_indices] <- NA
  return(x)
}

data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    `The course workload is manageable within my schedule.` = introduce_NAs(`The course workload is manageable within my schedule.`),
    `Feedback from assignments is helpful for my learning.` = introduce_NAs(`Feedback from assignments is helpful for my learning.`)
  )
```

## Core functionality

### The `unify()` function

The `unify()` function groups together Likert-style responses for a given question or set of questions, returning a summarised output that contains the n and proportion for each of these groupings.

```{r unify, error=TRUE}
unify(data, cols = 1, # ...dataframe name and column index number(s) to analyse
      
      # Below, we 'group' responses via custom grouping labels (e.g. 'Agree'):
      Agree = c("Somewhat agree", "Strongly agree"),
      Disagree = c("Somewhat disagree", "Strongly disagree"),
      Neutral = "Neither agree nor disagree",

      ignore = "Don't know") # ...optionally, set response(s) to ignore from calcs
```

The grouping labels can be anything you like. For example, `Agree` could instead be `Positive`, `Good`, `Satisifed` or something else entirely. Similarly, `Don't know` could be its own group, instead of being ignored. You may include as many grouping labels as you'd like.

There's of course nothing wrong with having just 1 response option per group (e.g. `"Somewhat agree" = "Somewhat agree"`). The main purpose of `unify()` is that it forces you to be **intentional** with how you handle your data, to improve consistency and avoid mistakes.

### Left out responses

If you forgot to include a response in your custom groupings, `unify()` will throw an error. This is crucial for avoiding mistakes in your proportion calculations. For example:

```{r error, error=TRUE}
unify(data, 1, Agree = "Somewhat agree",
                #"Strongly agree"), -- let's stop unify() from seeing this line
      Disagree = c("Somewhat disagree", "Strongly disagree"),
      Neutral = "Neither agree nor disagree",
      ignore = "Don't know") 
```

As seen above, the output tells you that you forgot to assign "Strongly agree" to a grouping variable.

These errors are crucial, since other R functions do not warn you if you haven't accounted for a group, or mistyped "Strongly **A**gree", as "Strongly **a**gree", for example.

### Data for unify()

The `unify()` function expects data that looks like this:

```{r head, echo=FALSE, error=TRUE}
head(data, n = 10)
```

Responses do not need to be consistently labelled either within or between different questions/columns, and can contain missing data (you'll likely want to assign `NA` to the ignore parameter).

### View column index numbers

Since GroupThink functions work with column **index numbers**, not column names, you'll likely want to summarise all index numbers of your dataset. For this, run `colnames()` from base-R.

```{r colnames, error=TRUE}
colnames(data)
```

## The `assess()` function

You might find it beneficial to run GroupThink's `assess()` function, which provides an overview of the different response options in your specified columns.

```{r assess, error=TRUE}
assess(data, cols = c(2, 3))
```

## Further functionality

#### Aggregate across multiple columns/questions

You are not restricted to analysing just one question/column with `unify()`. You can specify multiple columns/questions to use for the output:

```{r cols, error=TRUE}
unify(data, c(1, 2, 3), # ...analyse Columns 1, 2 and 3
      Positive = c("Somewhat agree", "Strongly agree", "Highly agree", "Agree"),
      Negative = c("Somewhat disagree", "Strongly disagree", "Highly disagree",
                   "Disagree"),
      ignore = c(NA, "Don't know", "Unsure", "Neither agree nor disagree",
                 "No opinion", "Indifferent"),
      
      hideN = TRUE) # ...(optional) hide n column from output (a lot cleaner!)
```

...Just make sure that you've accounted for each response option across your range of columns, otherwise you'll get an error.

#### Make formatted tables

Using the gtTable argument, `unify()` makes it simple to create nice, formatted tables.

```{r gtTable, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
unify(data, 1, Agree = c("Somewhat agree", "Strongly agree"),
      Disagree = c("Somewhat disagree", "Strongly disagree"),
      Neutral = "Neither agree nor disagree",
      ignore = "Don't know",
      filter = c("Agree", "Disagree"),
      hideN = TRUE, # ...optionally, hide N column
      
      gtTable = TRUE) # ...set gtTable to TRUE

```

#### Filter out responses from the output only

If you want to only display one response option in the output, we can use the `filter` argument.

Note that this is different from the `ignore` parameter: `filter` removes unwanted responses *after* the calculations have been performed, while `ignore` removes them *before*.

```{r filter, error=TRUE}
unify(data, 3,
      Agree = c("Agree", "Strongly agree"),
      Disagree = c("Disagree", "Strongly disagree"),
      Neither = c("No opinion", "Indifferent"),
      ignore = c(NA, "Don't know"),
      
      filter = "Agree") # ...only include the Agree group in the output
```

The other variable groupings are used for the calculations, but only "Agree" responses are shown in the final output.

#### Integrate with ggplot

Unless you've set `unify()`'s gt_table() argument to `TRUE`, it will output as a tibble. This means it integrates neatly into `ggplot()` function calls.

Let's pretend we've already run `unify()` on columns 1, 2 & 3, and assigned it to the name `united`...

```{r united, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=TRUE, results='hide'}
united <- unify(data, c(1, 2, 3),
                Agree = c("Agree", "Strongly agree", "Highly agree",
                          "Somewhat agree"),
                Disagree = c("Disagree", "Strongly disagree", "Highly disagree",
                             "Somewhat disagree"),
                ignore = c("Neither agree nor disagree", "Unsure", "Indifferent",
                           "Don't know", "No opinion", NA))
```

```{r ggplot, error=TRUE}
ggplot(data = united, # ...unify() output becomes ggplot()'s data argument
       aes(x = Question, y = `Agree (Proportion)`, fill = Question)) +
  geom_col() +
  
  # ...below are just optional customisation options:
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "coral", "chartreuse3")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 70)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Even more functionality

For other functionality not covered in this document, please run `?unify()` and `?assess()` to view the help files, which covers all function parameters.

## Future plans

-   Add support for `stargazer` tables into `unify()`.

-   Develop a separate function for analysing multiple choice data for data formats typical of exported survey data.
